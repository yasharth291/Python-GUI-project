Data Structures : Crops Ware house Inventory management system – Dash Board system

Objective :To develop a Dash Board system using various Data structure :

Disadvantages of the existing system: 
1.	Lack of an Automated  digital system for collecting and processing  the information
2.	Manual dependency resulting in the delay of On Time  data retrieval. 

New system development : From Class of CS102 B Section - Project Teams
•	Hardware and  System Software requirements : Not required

Facilities to be designed and developed :
1.	Create a Digital Dash board system for Office Managers to View, Retrieve crops data from the System  (identify various data fields and data types)
2.	Store the retrieved information on external File system for later use
(identify the file formats or mechanism to store the retrieved information details)
3.	Whenever there is an additional crop enters the warehouse, add the details to the inventory

Scope of the New System : 

1.	New System should provide the following information:
1.	For a given year, retrieve Crop wise productivity details and store it in a file
2.	For a given Crop, Draw the graph of year wise productivity details. 
2.	Whenever new item comes to the ware house, add the item to the inventory data.
3.	Users are allowed to view the above data but cannot add to the inventory
4.	Admins can add the data to the inventory.

Problem Statement : Design an efficient Data structure enabled system  for the Crops Ware house inventory. Use Lists, Dictionary, File system, Class objects, Def functions as necessary. Use the Data file provided with the Problem.
Functions : Retrieval of Crop wise and year wise data as mentioned above.
Clearly specify all the assumptions made during the Data Structure identification and data retrieval process.
