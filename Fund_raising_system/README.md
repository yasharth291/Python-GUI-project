# Fund-Tracking-System
Data Structures : Funds tracking System
Objective :To develop a Fund Transfer system Data structure :
Disadvantages of existing Manual system:
1. Tacking Process is time consuming, often leads to error prone
results.
2. Probability Data misinterpretation is high.
3. Lack of reporting missing data.
New system development : CS102 B Section- Project Team 3
• Hardware and Software requirements : Not required
• Software Application requirements : Required
Facilities to be developed :
• Ensure all the transactions are secured and stored at every stage
• Maintain transparency in every transaction (option to access funds data
at any point of time by the registered users)

funds transfer details related to their transactions.
This project/system aims at maintaining all information regarding Funds
transfers done in the organisation. System also aims at a secured funds
transfer environment with transparency to both users and admins.
